	<h3>Python</h3>
	<p>
		<p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms. The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.

	<h3>Django</h3>
	<p>
		<p>Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Django was designed to help developers take applications from concept to completion as quickly as possible. Django takes security seriously and helps developers avoid many common security mistakes. Some of the busiest sites on the Web leverage Django’s ability to quickly and flexibly scale.
		</p>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>The URL dispatcher (urls.py) maps the requested URL to a view function and calls it. If caching is enabled, the view function can check to see if a cached version of the page exists and bypass all further steps, returning the cached version, instead.
				</li>
				<li>The view function performs the requested action, which typically involves reading or writing to the database. It may include other tasks, as well.
				</li>
				<li>The model defines the data in Python and interacts with it. Although typically contained in a relational database, other data storage mechanisms are possible as well.
				</li>
				<li>Templates typically return HTML pages. The Django template language offers HTML authors a simple-to-learn syntax while providing all the power needed for presentation logic.
				</li>
				<li>After performing any requested tasks, the view returns an HTTP response object to the web browser.</li>
			</ul>

	<h3>TextBlob</h3>
	</p>TextBlob is a Python (2 and 3) library for processing textual data. It provides a simple API for diving into common natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, classification, translation, and more. TextBlob aims to provide access to common text-processing operations through a familiar interface. TextBlob objects can be treated as if they were Python strings that learned how to do Natural Language Processing. The sentiment property returns a named tuple of the form Sentiment (polarity, subjectivity). The polarity score is a float within the range [-1.0, 1.0]. The subjectivity is a float within the range [0.0, 1.0] where 0.0 is very objective and 1.0 is very subjective.
	</p>
	<h3>Bootstrap</h3>
	<p>Bootstrap is a free and open-source collection of tools for creating websites and web applications. It contains HTML- and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions. The bootstrap framework aims to ease web development. Bootstrap is a front end that is an interface between the user and the server-side code which resides on the "backend" or server. And it is a web application framework that is a software framework which is designed to support the development of dynamic websites and web applications.

	<h3>Running the Project</h3>
	<p>
		<ol>
			<li>Enable virtual environment using the command: “source /py3env/bin/activate”</li>
			<li>Navigate to the project folder.</li>
			<li>Run the application on the local host using the command : “python manage.py runserver”</li>
			<li>Open the web browser and enter the url “localhost:8000/main”.</li>
			<li>Enter the company ticker in the textbox.</li>
			<li>Press the “Analyse” button.</li>
			<li>The project computes and displays the predicted stock price for that company.</li>
